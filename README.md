# Authorized Greetings - By pobletacio

First add test wallets declared on .env.example (Admin, greeter, unauthorized greeter), then the deploy script itself is gonna airdrop with XLM every accounts set

```bash
cd soroban-react-dapp/
docker-compose up -d
bash run.sh
cd contracts
make build
yarn install
yarn deploy testnet authorized_greeting
yarn test testnet
exit (or open another bash)
```

At this point you Import your Stellar Secret Key's on Freighter, with test script execution admin was initialiazed and asigned, has only one greeter that can set a greet an the unauthorized greeter can only read the message.

* Admin can add more Authorized greeters using UI
* Authorized Greeter can set and read the last greet
* Unauthorized Greeter can only read the last greet


Finally compile the UI:
```bash
yarn install 
npm run dev
```

**PD: THIS IS MY FIRST TIME PROGRAMMING ON RUST AND USING A BLOCKCHAIN SDK! :D**

# @create-soroban-dapp.

@create-soroban-dapp is both a npx script and a boilerplate dapp for kickstarting any of your ideas for a Soroban-based Dapp.

Largely inspired by the [ink!athon](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon) project by [Scio Labs](https://github.com/scio-labs) and by [@create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) by [T3 Open Source](https://github.com/t3-oss) for the script mechanisms.

Check the [`LIVE VERSION`](https://create-soroban-dapp.vercel.app/) of the dapp utilizing already deployed testnet contract!

***Read the docs [here](create-soroban-dapp.paltalabs.io)***  ðŸ“šðŸ“š

# Introduction

`@create-soroban-dapp` is composed of two things:

- A boilerplate dapp utilizing the [@soroban-react](https://github.com/paltalabs/soroban-react).

- A npx script allowing any developer to quickstart its project via the command line and `npx create-soroban-dapp`

# Usage:

Simply use

`npx create-soroban-dapp@latest`

or

`npm create soroban-dapp@latest`

Then, cd inside the new project repository.

# Troubleshooting

## If npm create script malfunctions

The script in its early stage is likely to not function perfectly on every different os and configuration. If the script happens to not function properly 'please report to @benjaminsalon' on the stellar developer discord channel.

## Manual cloning

It is also possible to use the dapp boilerplate via manually cloning the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:paltalabs/create-soroban-dapp.git`

The dapp will then not be in the root folder, this folder is occupied by the npx script. You will find the dapp in the sub folder 'soroban-react-dapp':

`cd soroban-react-dapp`

From there, it is a normal nextjs app:

`yarn` or `npm install` or `pnpm install`


# Set up your secrets!
When deploying our contracts, we will need to the secret key of the deployer account. This secret key will be in a ignored file in `./contracts/.env`.

To set up your secrets do
```bash
cp contracts/.env.example contracts/.env
```
If you are already inside the contracts folder (due to being inside the Docker Container), just do `cp .env.example .env`

And then edit the `.env` file, that will look like this:
```bash
# Stellar accounts Secret Keys
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=

# RPC Setup
MAINNET_RPC_URL=
```
You can generate new Accounts and Private Keys from https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test

If you plan to deploy in Mainnet, you will also need a Mainnet RPC Provider. Find one in https://app.validationcloud.io/ or in https://nownodes.io/ 


# Get those containers up!

We will use docker-compose to get the containers up and running. This will rise a container for a local Stellar blockchain and another container with soroban-preview, which has all the necessary dependancies to deploy and interact with the contracts. Along with the dapp container that will run the front-end of the dapp.

```bash
# move to the right directory
cd soroban-react-dapp/

# Then, run the containers
docker compose up -d

# To get inside the soroban-preview container
bash run.sh 
# or 
# docker exec --tty --interactive soroban-contracts bash
```
Inside the container we can now compile the contracts, install the packages and deploy the contracts.

```bash
# move to the contracts folder
cd contracts

# build
make build

# Install dependencies and deploy the contract
yarn install
yarn deploy testnet greeting
```
Now we can run our frontend

```bash
# move to the parent folder
cd ..
# install the dependencies
yarn
# run the frontend in development mode
yarn dev
